            <p>
              Founded by a group of avid readers and literature enthusiasts,
              Literary Lights was born from a shared love for the written word.
              Our journey began with a simple yet profound idea: to create a
              haven for book lovers where they can discover, explore, and
              connect with the stories that enrich our lives.
